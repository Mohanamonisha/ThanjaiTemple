History of Thanjai temple, structure and culture will be detailed here.
The Chola reign declined and they were ousted by the Pandyas who were in turn thrown over by the Vijayanagara Empire.
In 1535, the Vijayanagara king installed a Nayak king and the clan, called Tanjore Nayaks, reigned till the mid-17th century.
In 1674, the Marathas conquered Tanjore. 
Later, like the rest of the country, Thanjavur too fell into British hands.
