History of Thanjai temple, structure and culture will be detailed here.
The Chola reign declined and they were ousted by the Pandyas who were in turn thrown over by the Vijayanagara Empire.
In 1535, the Vijayanagara king installed a Nayak king and the clan, called Tanjore Nayaks, reigned till the mid-17th century.
In 1674, the Marathas conquered Tanjore. 
Later, like the rest of the country, Thanjavur too fell into British hands.

The inscriptions and frescoes on the walls of Brihadeeswarar Temple record the rise and fall of the city’s fortunes. 
Shiva’s representation is as a gigantic stone lingam. 
This is covered by a vimanam that extends to 216 feet. 
It is built with stones that are bonded and notched without any mortar. 
The topmost stone, an engineering marvel, weighs about eighty tons.
